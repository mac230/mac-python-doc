* mac-python-doc
My function to display documentation from python's 'help()' function in a
temporary documentation buffer.  The function starts by looking for a symbol at
point.  If one is found, python's 'help' function is called with this symbol as
its argument.  If no symbol is present at point, the user is prompted for a
string via 'read-string'.  The function then creates a temporary buffer of the
output of the help command and displays this buffer in a separate window.  Point
is returned to its previous window and location in the current buffer.  If no
documentation is found, the help buffer displays a function indicating as much.
